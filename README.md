# Airline Cargo Optimization Model

## Description

The Airline Cargo Optimization Model is an advanced analytical tool designed to maximize efficiency in cargo loading for airline flights. This solution leverages complex algorithms to balance cargo weight and volume against flight capacity constraints, ensuring optimal use of available space while adhering to safety regulations.

## Product Overview

The model provides a streamlined, user-friendly interface for inputting cargo and flight data and outputs a detailed optimization plan. It's built to handle the dynamic and complex nature of airline cargo management, offering real-time solutions that adapt to changing conditions.

### Key Features:

- **Capacity Maximization**: It accurately calculates the best cargo load for each flight, maximizing the use of available weight and volume capacities.
- **Prioritization Handling**: The model can handle priority cargo, ensuring that high-priority items are given the appropriate level of importance in the optimization process.
- **Customization**: Tailored to accommodate different aircraft types and flight routes, the model adapts to various operational needs and preferences.
- **Safety Compliance**: The optimization respects all safety guidelines related to weight and balance of the aircraft.
- **Real-Time Adjustments**: Capable of adjusting to last-minute changes in cargo or flight schedules, providing airlines with the flexibility needed for day-to-day operations.
- **Reporting and Analysis**: Generates comprehensive reports detailing cargo loads, unused capacities, and other key metrics for operational analysis.

### Benefits:

- **Increased Efficiency**: Optimizes cargo placement, leading to reduced fuel consumption and increased flight efficiency.
- **Cost Reduction**: Helps in lowering operational costs by maximizing cargo load and reducing the number of flights required to transport goods.
- **Improved Planning**: Enhances cargo booking and flight planning processes, allowing for better resource allocation and scheduling.
- **Scalability**: Scales to meet the needs of both small carriers and large international airlines.

### How It Works:

Users upload a zip file containing the necessary CSV files with cargo and flight details. The Cargo Optimization Model processes this data and outputs a JSON file with an optimized loading plan for each flight.

### Input:

- `cargo_manifest.csv`: Contains details about each cargo item, including weight, volume, and priority.
- `flight_capacity.csv`: Includes information on each flight's capacity and other relevant details.

### Output:

- A JSON file with optimized cargo load for each flight, taking into account total weight and volume and unused capacities.

### Getting Started:

1. Prepare your cargo and flight capacity data according to the specified CSV formats.
2. Upload the zip file through the model interface.
3. Run the optimization model.
4. Download the JSON output for the optimal cargo loading plan.
